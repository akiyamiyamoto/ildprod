# Calibration samples

## Input files for calibration  

#### uds samples  
- DIRAC LFN:/ilc/mc-2008/generated/ucam_uds  
  Energy: 91GeV, 200GeV, 360GeV, 500GeV  
  These samples were generated at the time of LOI study by M.Thomson. The original URL,  http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/stdhep/, is not accessible now.
  Copies of them will be found at following local paths;
  KEK : /group/ilc/soft/samples/gen/MThomson/   
  DESY: /pnfs/desy.de/ilc/mc-2008/generated/ucam_uds/  
  
- DIRAC LFN:/ilc/user/s/sgreen/StdHepFiles/Z_uds  
  Energy: 67 energy points from 30GeV to 3000GeV
  They were generated by Steve Green.  Copies of them will be found at following local paths;
